Our program takes the users age and provides an appropriate response. 

TO USE THIS CODE
1. copy the Part1.ipynb file into the directory you wish to run it from.
For example, if you want to run a program in a directory called "MyDirectory", then you should place Part1.ipynb into MyDirectory, so it's location is now "MyDirectory\Part1.ipynb"
2. Make an import statement using Part1.ipynb
For example at the top of your program type "import Part1 as \<your reference\>"
3. Call the interact method
Part1.interact()
